            In the dim recesses of Academia, my dreams collided with the harsh reality that an opinion can affect creative
            integrity. I found myself in a whirlwind of chaos, confusion and excessive amounts of caffeine. I was
            inadvertently thrusted into a demanding world where teamwork was essential. This was coupled with persistent
            panic attacks induced by the consumption of too many energy drinks. It felt like the universe was conspiring
            against my sanity, dangling me over an edge for four mentally exhausting years.
            <br /><br />
            While other students harbored dreams of global directorial acclaim, my ambitions were firmly rooted in
            pragmatism. My goal was to cultivate skills that could pave a way to financial stability, facilitating my ascent
            into a higher tax bracket for all the politicians I didn't vote for, but I'm getting ahead of myself. While some
            may view education merely as a means of survival, I saw it as a versatile tool to fend off hunger by entertaining
            people with things that looked pretty. Now, how do I get them to pay me?
            <br /><br />
            With each passing year, my weary steps mirrored the weight of sleepless nights, culminating in the receipt of a
            Bachelor's Degree: A piece of paper that seemed absurd amidst the tumultuous journey to obtain it. Yet, within
            the preposterousness of pursuing it, there lay a strange allure from the audacity it took to attain this
            document. And so, with a tired smile and a heart heavy with relief, I bid farewell to the treacherous landscapes
            this piece of paper compelled me to navigate.

            Graduation was meant to herald my arrival into adulthood, but instead, all I received was a tax number tethered
            to my name. It turns out the money you sign for doesn't reflect the amount paid into your bank account. Why
            didn't anyone explain this to me, Mother? Anyway, being broke isn't as exhilarating as it sounds, I know, right?
            It's enough to drive most people to do anything, and that's how I stumbled through two doomed feature films
            before ending up in the heart of Hillbrow, chasing carpentry gigs. Yes, the one in Johannesburg.
            <br /><br />
            The name of the series was "Ithuba," and it never graced television screens because of... reasons. Our art
            department was a team of three, and we scrounged for materials by day before piecing them together by night. We
            used discarded pallets and fake grass to complete the bare minimum, and I'm pretty certain we accrued more debt
            at the end of the ordeal. As dusk settled, we rested our weary bodies on dilapidated couches in a penthouse
            nestled within the crime capital of South Africa; daily commutes weren't factored into our budget. Despite the
            worn appearance of these sofas, they proved surprisingly comfy. After three months of shooting, the director had
            to pitch the pilot episode to the very producers withholding our salaries.
            <br /><br />
            Reality hit the crew like a ton of bricks when the video editor showed us a cut of the pilot episode, his magnum
            opus. The final product was more pixelated than the face of a person who asked to remain anonymous. It's as if
            the editor was trying to hide all the mistakes we made as an art department by compressing the video its lowest
            resolution. I believe he ran out of disk space, but that's beside the point. Unsurprisingly, this failed to
            impress. The entire crew abandoned the project with unpaid salaries and left with a bond that can only be forged
            through a shared dream driven by desperation. But hey, at least it provided me with enough material to
            incorporate a somewhat respectable logo into my portfolio. Ah, the absurdity of it all.

            Let's rewind the clock to my days as a film student, where the thought of a lecture on rifle mics was about as
            enthralling as watching paint dry. But fate had surprises in store for me that day. Enter Professor Frank, a
            maestro of dry wit and subtle humor capable of breathing life into any topic, no matter how mundane. Initially, I
            was more bored than a toddler stripped of their iPad. I found myself sitting in the classroom as Professor Frank
            brandished his very own rifle mic with gusto and that's where things became intriguing. He turned a discussion
            about oscillating magnets into a symphony of "unintentional" innuendos, eliciting giggles that bubbled from the
            back of the classroom like a pair of mice having a brawl in your attic. His intention, I reckon, was to grab the
            students' attention.
            <br /><br />
            That's when a figure sauntered into the classroom and interrupted Professor Frank's chain of thought. The man who
            entered looked like a relic from the Woodstock era and exuded the sassiness of someone who would roll their eyes
            at you while munching on avocado toast. His mission? To lure unsuspecting students into an internship for a film
            dubbed "Somer Son". Little did I know, this day would mark not only my enlightenment on the mechanics microphones
            but also the beginning of my short journey into cinema. That night, with the click of a button I sent him an
            email with my trusty Curriculum Vitae: A document boasting less substance than a politician's promises. To my
            astonishment, in July 2014, I was whisked away with a crew for a movie shoot in Mozambique.
            <br /><br />
            Now, back to me toiling away on the SABC project. My phone rang. On the other end? None other than the hippie
            himself, Clinton Lubbe, munching away on a piece of avocado toast as we talked. And so began a collaboration that
            would launch my career into the stratosphere of success. From delving into televisual wizardry to concocting
            YouTube content that struck gold, every endeavor seemed to flourish. Our music videos, featuring the likes of Jo
            Black, Robbie Wessels, Bok van Blerk and Appel, garnered millions of views. We ran a relatively successful
            photography channel which was modest in subscriber count but had a dedicated fan base that spiked our views.

          <p>
            One day, I received a call from a friend with whom I had collaborated with at Tshwane University of Technology.
            His name is Brenton, and over time, he became a father to three daughters, with the second pair being twins. Poor
            guy: They say if you have a boy, you have to look after him, but if you have a girl, then you have to look after
            the whole neighborhood. Now, multiply that by three, and you can't help but feel for him. I should really give
            him a call, but I digress. During our conversation, he mentioned that it might be a good idea for me to apply for
            an editing job at Green Planet Productions, where he worked at that time. This suggestion came at a time when my
            career as a freelancer was flourishing. I was collaborating with an Afrikaans record label called "Inhoud Huis",
            owned by a composer named Johan Vorster.
            <br /><br />
            With that being said, I applied for the job and was interviewed by Francois Nolte, who agreed to hire me as an
            hourly employee. Stepping into the workplace, I was greeted by none other than Schalk Burger. Despite his
            penchant for airing grievances, he had a knack for attention to detail and an unwavering dedication to quality.
            His ability to pinpoint flaws, while occasionally overwhelming new hires with depressed thoughts about being a
            video editor, undoubtedly influenced the perspectives of many in this line of work. Still, one couldn't help but
            wonder if his perpetual grumbling was a cunning ploy to test the endurance of potential editors. After all, who
            wouldn't lock themselves in a room with him on a daily basis to brave the daily deluge of complaints...until, of
            course, he no longer worked there.
            <br /><br />
            For the next 6 months, I endured the monotony of a desk job, tethered to the task of editing a television show
            that highlighted the top Afrikaans songs of the week. Each episode demanded meticulous crafting, starting with a
            song ranked at number 20 before counting down to the coveted number 1 spot, encompassing a full 45 minutes.
            Amidst this routine, I found solace in witnessing three of my music videos ascend to the top of the charts. Then
            came Francois Nolte's offer for a permanent contract with a fixed salary. Despite the appeal of a stable income,
            I hesitated. The creative energy and success of my other ventures stood in stark contrast to the mundanity of the
            future he offered. At that time, it was one of the toughest decisions of my life. The prospect of burning bridges
            and facing disapproval from powerful industry producers wasn't something to be taken lightly. Ultimately, I
            declined the offer, firmly closing the doors of Green Planet Productions. It was a moment fraught with
            uncertainty, yet tinged with the excitement of forging my own path forward. That remained true until Clinton
            Lubbe's studio was ransacked at the end of November 2017.

            __Rewrite__ References: Pieter Lombaard (Ghost Episode). I'm breaking the flow of the timeline as this correlates
            with my career as a freelancer. Before I move into the next chapter where Akademia hired me. My primary
            responsibilities were to oversee and manage the production of sports-related content. This included television
            shows about competitions taking place within South Africa. I had to work closely with a team of producers to
            write, develop and execute a creative vision for each project. This involved brainstorming ideas and writing
            scripts about the events before recording it in a studio. I also balanced the audio using a set criteria for
            television productions. The scoreboard animations were also made from scratch to give each episode a custom look
            & feel. Along with that, I also logged and confirmed information about competitions to write an accurate story
            about the events that transpired. I chose to work with Akademia since I realised as I grew older that a stable
            salary might be the safer option moving forward with paying bills. Plus I had the opportunity to educate myself
            for free, even if it didn't entail writing tests for another degree.
