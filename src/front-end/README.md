# [Front-end Documentation](https://github.com/TertiusRoach/development-portfolio_2.00)

This directory functions as the [User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) component of the application. The purpose of this documentation is to offer a detailed insight into the organization of files and folders, with the goal of promoting clarity to support smooth scalability in projects. The structure is meticulously crafted to reduce the chances of introducing errors in the code. Files are arranged strategically to minimize unnecessary code and ensure a clear understanding of each document's role. The categorization of files is designed to be intuitive, making it easier for both novice and experienced developers to comprehend, particularly as the project's complexity grows.

## Pages Folder

This specifically concerns the [front-end](https://github.com/TertiusRoach/development-portfolio_2.00/tree/main/src/front-end) structure. The [page directory](https://github.com/TertiusRoach/development-portfolio_2.00/tree/main/src/front-end/pages) is at the heart of front-end functionality, and the [index](https://github.com/TertiusRoach/development-portfolio_2.00/tree/main/src/front-end/pages/index) folder serves as the default testing location. The **~content** folder offers insightful recommendations on optimal resolutions for various file formats, providing rationale for specific image resolutions to maintain consistency. Crafted with meticulous attention to detail, this document prioritizes clear navigation and delivers comprehensive references for each file format, contributing to heightened efficiency and quality in the front-end development process.

### Global Styling

This [SASS file](https://github.com/TertiusRoach/development-portfolio_2.00/blob/main/src/front-end/pages/global-styling.scss) acts as an override, enabling the modification of specific designs within the Bootstrap framework. A foundational structure is already established, providing flexibility in adjusting default values.

### Corporate Identity

This [SASS file](https://github.com/TertiusRoach/development-portfolio_2.00/blob/main/src/front-end/pages/corporate-identity.scss) encapsulates the default values for a company's registered colors and logos. It also defines global defaults for CSS margins and padding of HTML elements. Typically, I initialize these defaults to zero and then customize them based on the specific design requirements.

### [Content Directory](https://github.com/TertiusRoach/development-portfolio_2.00/tree/main/src/front-end/pages/index/~content)

Each file format has a distinct purpose, and through experience, I've discovered that the choice of format significantly influences the outcome based on specific requirements.

### ICO Files: Default Resolution = **256x256**

Ideal for small graphical representations, typically used as website or application icons.

### GIF Files: Default Resolution = **500x500**

Suited for simple animations, logos, and images with limited colors, providing a lightweight solution.

### SVG Files: Default Resolution = **500x500**

Perfect for scalable graphics, such as logos and icons, as it maintains clarity at various sizes without loss of quality.

### JPG Files: Default Resolution = **1280x720 (720p)**

Well-suited for photographs and images with complex details, balancing quality and compression for efficient storage.

### PNG Files: Default Resolution = **3840x2160 (2160p)**

Well-suited for images requiring transparency and sharp details, commonly used for web graphics and logos.

### MP4 Files: Default Specifications = **1920x1080 (1080p)**

Excellent for video content, supporting high-quality compression with broad compatibility across platforms. I usually set my videos to 25 frames per second.
